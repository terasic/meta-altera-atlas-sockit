To build the 'pov_demo.c' application simply run the 'build_pov_demo.sh'
shell script.  That will compile the 'pov_demo.c' source file and produce the
executable 'pov_demo' application.  Refer to the 'build_pov_demo.sh' script to
see how the application is actually compiled and refer to the C program
source file for more details on how it actually works.

Once you've built the application, you can run the applications like this:

./pov_demo
